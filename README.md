# Spotify Audio Features of The National

By: Codey Phoun

This is a small project where Spotify Audio Features for my favorite band, The National, are retrieved from the Spotify API with the spotipy library. These audio features for The National are then analyzed and visualized to practice my Pandas and Seaborn skills and to satisfy my curiosity.

Spotipy_The_National.ipynb downloads the Spotify Audio Features and creates the file National_studio_albums.csv

TheNational_Visualization.ipynb contains the data visualization of these features with popularity and play data.
